# How to install Backstage UI

## How to import BUI's global styles

Backstage UI works by importing a global CSS file at the root of your application. This file includes all the default styles for the components.
First, you'll need to install the package using a package manager. For example, if you're using Yarn:

<CodeBlock
  lang="shell"
  title="Run this command in your `packages/app` directory"
  code={`yarn add @backstage/ui`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  lang="tsx"
  title="Add this line to `packages/app/src/index.tsx`"
  code={`import '@backstage/cli/asset-types';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import '@backstage/ui/css/styles.css'; // [!code ++]

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />);`}
/>

<Banner
  text="Import these styles only once at your application root. Plugin developers should skip this step to avoid conflicts."
  variant="warning"
/>

## How to use BUI components

As a plugin maintainer, you can use BUI components in your plugin. As mentioned above, you should not import the styles
again in your plugin as this will be handled at the root of your application. To get started, just add the library to
your plugin and import the components you need.

<CodeBlock
  lang="shell"
  title="Run this command in your `packages/[your-plugin]` directory"
  code={`yarn add @backstage/ui`}
/>

<CodeBlock lang="tsx" title="Let's get started ðŸš€" code={snippet} />
