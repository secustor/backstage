Added support for Postgres 18 to the available `TestDatabases`.

Note that the set of _default_ databases to test against for users of the `TestDatabases` class was also updated to include Postgres 14 and 18, instead of 13 and 17. If you need to override this, you can pass in an explicit `ids` argument, for example `ids: ['POSTGRES_17', 'POSTGRES_13', 'SQLITE_3']`.
